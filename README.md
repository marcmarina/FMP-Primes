## How to run
To run the project, install dependencies with either `yarn` or `npm` and then run the `start` script with whichever package manager you're using. Alternatively, run `node .` in the project's root.

## What I like about my solution
I like the small tweaks I've made to my prime generating functions to optimise them a bit. They are nothing spectacular, but they add up. I have managed to bring the time it takes to generate 20000 primes from 7 seconds down to 12ms.

## What I don't like
I would have liked implementing the Miller-Rabin primality test, but it was taking me too long and I couldn't manage it in a reasonable timeframe.
